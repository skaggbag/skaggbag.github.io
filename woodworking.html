            <h2>Woodworking Projects</h2>
            <p>I passed the safety class just in time for 2023 club projects. Being a highly motivated self starter, I thought
                a good first project would be an 18th century sheraton sofa table replica. Little did I know that I was making a
                multi-year commitment.
            </p>
            <p>Somewhere along the way a member of the class needed to remake a leg and we figured it would be a good opportunity
                to make a matching sheraton end table for Mother's Day 2023 (if we are going to go back and make a leg we might
                as well make 9 while the machines are still set up, haha). My mother did not receive a Sheraton End Table for
                Mother's Day 2023 or for Mother's Day 2024.
            </p>
            <p>I kept my cards close to my chest. No one knew about extra tables. Making sheraton tables takes years and I obviously
                do not make them for other people.
            </p>
            <p>On the day of the delivery, I had the scene all planned out in my mind. My mother, overwhelmed with surprise and gratitude,
                would burst into tears. Upon entering the house she was coming down the stairs. I indicated that the table I was carrying
                belonged to her. She smiled and promptly began moving furniture around the living room, apparently with a place already
                picked out for the table. She said "It's a good thing you made me one, I had my eye on your talbe."
