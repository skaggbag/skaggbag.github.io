            <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>
            <p>Welcome! My name is John Skaggs. I am a Catholic West Virginian. I went to Marshall University where I studied
            civil engineering and applied mathematics with some post graduate work in mathematics. Since college I have worked
            primarily on bridges and bridge-like structures. Some of my interests will be documented in the links above.
