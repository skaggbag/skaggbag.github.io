            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome! My name is John Skaggs. I am a Catholic West Virginian. I went to Marshall University where I studied
            civil engineering and applied mathematics with some post graduate work in mathematics. Since college I have worked
            primarily on bridges and bridge-like structures. Some of my interests will be documented in the links above.
            Thank you for visiting!

            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>I enjoy learning about computers and I have wanted to build a website since I was in college.
            As a solo hobbyist I have found it too burdensome and time consuming to undertake programming
            projects of any nontrivial size. I recently wanted to write a small program and was amazed at
            how quickly I was able to build it with an AI copilot in VSCode.
            This website is part of my experiments using an AI copilot for pair programming.
