            <h2>Stained Glass Projects</h2>
            <p>One of the guys in VWWV brought in a gorgeous wall clock and cabinet with a stained glass window that he had built. He mentioned that he had made the glass under the supervision of a woman who owned a stained glass studio in the area. I was impressed and resolved to make my way down there. I quite enjoyed working with Amanda and I hope to make some lamp shades later this summer when I am done with my end tables.</p>
